# 1-8-demultiplexer
1:8 Demultiplexer (DEMUX) in Verilog

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a 1:8 demultiplexer (DEMUX). A demultiplexer is a combinational circuit that takes a single input and distributes it to one of several outputs based on select lines.

Features

Implements a 1:8 demultiplexer.

Takes 1 data input, 3 select lines, and generates 8 outputs.

Outputs are mutually exclusive based on the select lines.

Written in Verilog HDL for ease of synthesis and simulation.
